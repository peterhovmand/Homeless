# Homeless

This repository has the latest version and documentation for a conceptual system dynamics simulation model of homeless populations in the United States from 2007 to 2027. The model was developed to illustrate homelessness from a complex systems perspective in Fowler et al. (2019). The model and overview can be accessed through an [online interface](https://socialsystemdesignlab.wustl.edu/items/homelessness-and-complex-systems/)

# Acknowledgement

The original model was developed and completed with the following project partners: Administration for Children and Families, National Institute of Child Health & Human Development, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
