Homeless model v4.0 5/20/18
1.6 million people served by homeless assistance programs (es, th, psh) in 2007
Trend has declined annually as funding and capacity has increased (unclear if erosion in quality identified in gaps analysis outpace capacity building)
10 million people in insecure housing, based on ACS estimate that 10 million households (probably 20 million people) were severely rent burnded (>50% rent), and 25-50% needed homeless assistance
Proportion of insecured seeking assistnace (reverse coded) is 60% 
Assumed people cycle through instability quickly with avg time of 2 years. so, about 5.25 million enter/reenter each year, and most are seeking some type of homeless assistance (3.35m). 
Risk of discontinuing seekign services is 50/50
People in homeless assistance stay for an average of 3.5 years based on AHAR Part 2 that suggests 50% psh stay 3 or more years (and # of psh skews avg times)
Risk of leaving assistance is set at 7% based on 2015 and 2016 system performance outcomes of success or retention
Fractional rate of entry from insecured to homeless is .4 but this declines given capacacity constraints
assume capacity is eroding slightly over time at .011, and with more capacity, more homeless assistance will be provided
